## Introduction 
I am a senior at the University of California, San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)) pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in ***Mathematics-Computer Science***. 
My goal is to become a full-stack software developer. I have not done any internships in the field of ***Computer Science*** 
but I do have educational experience in various programming languages such as **_C++, Python, Java,_ and _System Verilog_**. 
In addition, I am great at optimization, problem-solving, and data structures. Outside of my field of study, I am 
interested in learning about real estate and stocks. My favorite destination spot is [Paris](Images/Destination.jfif).

My favorite quote is by **Bernard M. Baruch**
> ***Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.***
